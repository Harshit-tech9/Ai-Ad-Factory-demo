# AI Ad Factory — Minimal UI

First-look UI for the dashboard, creative approval, and onboarding flow. No build step.

## How to view

1. **Open in browser:** Double-click `index.html` or drag it into a browser tab.
2. **Or serve locally (optional):**  
   From this folder run:
   - `npx serve .` or  
   - `python -m http.server 8080`  
   Then open `http://localhost:8080` (or the port shown).

## What’s inside

- **Dashboard** — ROAS, spend, cost per lead, conversions; budget bar; active campaign cards with Pause/View.
- **Creatives** — Approval queue: ad preview (image + copy + CTA) with Approve/Reject (demo: click to mark state).
- **Onboarding** — Chat-style preview of zero-prompt signup (“I run a boutique in Mumbai…”) and auto-extracted profile.

Design: mobile-first, warm palette (terracotta accent), DM Sans. Matches the spec’s dashboard and WhatsApp-first flows.
